For those who have always been bothered by the fact that the print bed of the Ender3 S1 is hard-wired, and if you tilt the printer backwards, the cable of the bed is pinched. At the latest, the fixed connected cable disturbs if you want to disassemble the print bed or use another.

With the bed power connector these problme are eliminated, of course, this can also be used for any other printer.

Parts used:
Norcomp Sub-D 680M7W2103L401,  
Norcomp Sub-D 680M7W2203L401

Main contacts loadable up to 40A, secondary contacts up to 5A

Connector housing for cable assembly nominal size : DA15 
It is necessary to take care that the solder terminals have enough space and that the cable fits into the cable gland (8.3mm).

The melt thread sets for 3D printing seem to be only metric (M3 in this case), D-Sub threads are however 4/40 UNC ! For this there are adapter threaded bolts

The cable of the print bed of the Ender 3 S1 has 5 wires 
two thick ones for the heating, two thin ones for the temperature sensor and one green/yellow one for the protective earth.

Here is the best positioning in my opinion.
Please check with your own printer that really nothing inside the housing is in the space!
